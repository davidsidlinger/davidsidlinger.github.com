title: Pair Programming Is Not Mentoring
location: Nashville
---

Most working programmers do not have the luxury of working in an environment where pair programming is an option. I have been lucky enough to work recently for a company that has made a large commitment to our project, a commitment large enough to afford us some time spent working in pairs. Having spent some time sharing a screen with my teammates in the past few months has caused me to believe something that I never thought I would. Pair programming completely fails as a mentoring technique.

I should define mentoring in this context. Mentoring is more than showing someone something new, it is the art of educating someone with significantly less skill or experience. It is trying to make a pro out of a rookie programmer. It is the transmission of some fundamental knowledge.

Pair programming's value is in the fluent exchange of ideas between peers and the consistency check performed by the person just watching what's going on. Two (or more) programmers operating at the same level with a shared vocabulary is a beautiful thing. They can accomplish more together than they could independently.

When half of the pair is in over his head it turns ugly quickly. The phrase "I see what you did there" is replaced with "What just happened?". Things are either moving too quickly for the learner to comprehend or so slowly that the teacher is bored or frustrated. Imagine two theoretical physicists having an excited conversation about the nature of the universe. Now replace one of them with a middle-schooler. Remember that an excellent developer is [an order of magnitude][McConnell] more productive than an average one if that seems extreme.

I believe in mentoring. It's the only way we're going to get better at this. I believe that we can all learn how to teach others what we know. Just don't ask me to teach you something and call it pairing.
