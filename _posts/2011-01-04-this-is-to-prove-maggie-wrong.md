<p class="slug">4 Jan 2011 - Nashville, Tennessee</p>

So, I want to write, and I want to own what I write. The Tumblr outage didn't affect me, the last time I used it (before today) was August 25. It did make me realize that any service could lose my content at any time. I don't want to put myself into something that could go away.

My desire to write locally and generate a static site (understandably) caused Maggie to call me "the Indie-Music Douchebag of computers." She alledged that I would spend more time fussing with a system than just writing.

She's wrong.
