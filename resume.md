## Profile

Code craftsman with experience delivering kick-ass software. I am passionate about quality and a firm believer in loving what one does.

## History

### Press Ganey Associates, Nashville, Tennessee
*Lead Software Developer*  
*2010–Present*

At Press Ganey, I lead a team actively developing an application used to analyze financial and clinical healthcare data.  In addition the team builds additional, more focused, tools made available as separately sold modules. The product is used to improve the quality of healthcare provided as well as the financial performance of healthcare organizations.

The team consistently exceeds expectations of quality and productivity. The application offers extreme flexibility in filtering and presentation of large data sets quickly and reliably. I relish the unique challenges of the product and derive much joy in delivering software that solves those challenges.

Few tools for building and manipulating MDX queries exist. The team built a tool to enforce syntactically correct construction, rewrite constructed queries, and build a set of classes representing the structure of the cube. New features that would have taken weeks to develop can be shipped in days without compromising quality.

My team and I have been used as an example of the productivity and quality that Press Ganey expects from its various programming teams. As the company has grown, my team has been called upon to mentor other clinical development teams in the tools, techniques, and processes we use to deliver frequent releases of high quality software.

I have also been successful in deterring others who impose tools and processes that do not work for the team through positive discourse and factual measurements. I am as proud of this as any technical achievement.

My responsibilities include:

* Design and implementation of new functionality
* Working with Product Management to define requirements and product direction
* Building a team culture of accountability and transparency
* Defining development, testing, and delivery processes
* Mentoring teams working on other clinical products
* Planning and coordinating efforts of multiple, geographically-separated teams

### HCA, Nashville, Tennessee
*Domain Architect*  
*2002-2010*

I provided the technical direction for multiple development teams supporting the Outpatient Services Group of HCA. My day-to-day work consisted of:

* Reviewing business needs and requests for new functionality or products to develop a cohesive plan for future work
* Designing software to align with the needs of the organization
* Providing technical guidance and mentoring to other software developers
* Working with QA and Operations personnel to guide the delivery of software to production
* Improving the software development process
* Working with management to produce realistic estimates of work

We were incredibly effective. Some of the accomplishments of my last few years:

* Enhanced and maintained a physician practice management system (PPMS) that supported over five hundred physician practices. The system was responsible for scheduling of patient visits, billing of medical claims, and back-office work needed to ensure those medical claims were paid. The system was used to electronically submit over ten million dollars in healthcare claims monthly. The team delivered system enhancements monthly for over a year. It was the largest centralized practice management software installation in existence.
* Designed and developed multiple interfaces and applications in support of a new practice management system purchased by HCA. The new system presented unique challenges to the team (e.g. the vendor was often not able or willing to provide the information needed to effectively work with PPMS data). The interfaces included uploading of accounting data to the general ledger, extracting patient visit statistics and and extracting patient account information used for delinquent payment collections. The applications included a utility used to replicate “master” information between multiple PPMS installations and a suite of tools used to process and post payments from insurance companies. All of these products were critical to the daily operations of the outpatient group.
* Designed and developed a system used to continue practice operations for when the new practice management system was offline. This system had stringent availability and security constraints (i.e. high-availability and protection of patient information to comply with ethical matters and federal laws). It played an important role many times during the rollout of the new PPMS. As a result, business continuity was achieved, regardless of downtime or performance degradation.
* Designed and developed a system used by physician recruiters to capture information about job opportunities while in the field and had the ability to synchronize with an existing CMS system. Prior to this software, printed forms were used which caused unnecessary delays and errors from keying the information into the primary CMS application days or weeks later. The application used local storage, which allowed the recruiters to work disconnected from the corporate network giving them the ability to synchronize with a centralized server upon connection.  As a result, recruiting efforts were vastly improved and recruiters had more timely access to vital information for the performance of their job.
* I am most proud of the role I played in building the team, improving the development process and fostering more positive interactions with business owners. When I started at HCA, development was flailing and subsequently somewhat unstructured. When I left, our team was used as a quintessential example of doing things right throughout the organization. I helped assemble a team that was both impressive in technical proficiency and in business competency. With the help of my leadership, the team moved from a process model based on big up-front design to an iterative process resulting in more quality control and deliveries on a more frequent basis. In addition, the team adopted and realized the benefits of unit testing, continuous integration and static analysis. Essentially I played an integral role in implementing a technology stack that yielded extreme efficiency and better alignment with the business needs of the company.

## Tools & Technology

The majority of my work for the past decade has been built using Microsoft's .NET Framework and related tools with an emphasis in C#. However, I am an avid technologist.  As such, I strongly believe exposure to other platforms and languages gives one the ability to use the appropriate technology stack for any project.  For example, I currently own several Mac OSX machines and frequently write software to run on the OSX platform.

I am an expert in C#, F#, Javascript, web development, team building and software design patterns. In addition, I am proficient with OCaml, Ruby, and Python. I can construct, troubleshoot and optimize complex SQL, although I prefer to let a competent tool chain to perform the heavy lifting.

I have delivered software on all releases of the .NET Framework. My most recent work is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC 3.
