## Profile

Code craftsman with experience delivering kick-ass software. I am passionate 
about quality and a firm believer in loving what you do.

## History

### Press Ganey Associates, Nashville, Tennessee
*Lead Software Developer*  
*2010–Present (First seven months as a consultant)*

At Press Ganey, I lead a team developing an application used by our customers 
to analyze financial and clinical healthcare data, along with focused tools 
built on the same data sets and made available as separately sold modules. The 
product is used to improve quality of care and the financial performance of 
healthcare organizations.

The team consistently exceeds expectations of quality and productivity. The 
application offers extreme flexibility in filtering and presentation of 
large data sets, quickly and reliably. I relish the unique challenges of 
the product and the joy of delivering software that leaves those challenges 
with a bloody nose.

Few tools for building and manipulating MDX queries exist. The team built a 
tool to enforce syntactically correct construction, rewrite constructed 
queries, and build a set of classes representing the structure of the cube. 
New features that would have taken weeks to develop can be shipped in days 
without comprimising quality.

My team and I have been used as an example of the productivity and quality 
that Press Ganey expects from its programming teams. As the company has grown,
we've been called upon to mentor other clinical development teams in the 
tools, techniques, and process we use to deliver frequent releases of high
quality software.

I've also been successful in warding off the people that seem determined to 
impose tools and processes that don't work for the team with reasonable 
discussions about hard measurements and without shouting matches. I'm as proud 
of this as any technical achievment.

My responsibilities include:

* Design and implementation of new functionality
* Working with Product Management to define requirements and product direction
* Building a team culture of accountability and transparency
* Defining development, testing, and delivery processes
* Mentoring teams working on other clinical products
* Planning and coordinating efforts of multiple, geographically-separated teams

### HCA, Nashville, Tennessee
*Domain Architect*  
*2002-2010 (First eighteen months as a consultant)*

I provided the technical direction for multiple development teams supporting 
the Outpatient Services Group of HCA. My day-to-day work consisted of:

* Reviewing business needs and requests for new functionality or products to 
  develop a cohesive plan for future work.
* Designing software to address the needs of the organization.
* Providing guidance to developers during construction.
* Mentoring developers to increase the kick-ass-edness of the team.
* Working with QA and Operations to smooth the delivery of software to 
  production.
* Improving process by any means necessary.
* Working with management to produce estimates of development and testing effort.

We were incredibly effective. Some of the accomplishments of my last few years:

* Enhanced and maintained a physician practice management system (PPMS) that 
  supported over five hundred physician practices. The system was responsible 
  for scheduling of patient visits, billing of claims related to those 
  visits, and the back-office work needed to ensure those claims are paid. 
  The system was used to file over ten million dollars in claims monthly.
  The team delivered enhancements to this system monthly for over a year. It 
  was the largest centralized practice management software installation in 
  existence.
* Designed and developed multiple interfaces and applications in orbit of a new 
  practice management system purchased by HCA. This system presented unique 
  challenges, as the vendor was often not able or willing to provide the 
  information needed to effectively work with PPMS data. The interfaces included 
  an upload of accounting data to the general ledger, an extract of patient 
  visit statistics, and an extract of patient account information used for 
  delinquent payment collections. The applications included a utility used to 
  replicate “master” information between multiple PPMS installations and a 
  suite of tools used to process and post payments from insurance companies. 
  All of these products were critical to the daily operations of the outpatient 
  group.
* Designed and developed a system used to continue practice operations, if and 
  when the replacement practice management system was offline. This software 
  had stringent availability and security constraints. It had to be available 
  at all times, and patient information had to remain protected until needed. 
  It was called into service many times during the rollout of the new PPMS. 
  Work in the practice proceeded, regardless of downtime or performance 
  degradation.
* Designed and developed a system used by physician recruiters to capture 
  information about job opportunities while in the field and sync the details 
  to a CMS system. Prior to this software, printed forms were used, causing 
  delays and errors associated with keying the information into the primary 
  application days or weeks later. Timely availability of job information is 
  critical to recruiters. The application used local storage, which allowed 
  the recruiters to work disconnected from the corporate network and sync with 
  a centralized server when connected.
* Designed and developed a system used to track the progress of opening or 
  acquiring new physician practices. This was a replacement for an existing 
  system that failed to meet performance and functional expectations. The new 
  system was designed to be customized and maintained by the end users. We 
  learned a lot of lessons about rewrites, feature creep, and YAGNI on this 
  project. I would consider it a success, but a painful one. We were too 
  worried about future needs and tried to pay for future maintenance up-front. 
  The development department — business development, not programming — lives 
  in this application and uses it for all their daily tasks. The system 
  allowed department management to get an accurate picture of the progress on 
  all their active projects.

I am most proud of the improvements we made to our team, our process, and our 
interactions with the business. When I started at HCA, development was flailing.
When I left, our team was used as an example throughout HCA IT of doing things 
right. We assembled a team that was impressive in both its technical 
proficiency and its understanding of the business. We moved from big design 
up-front to an iterative process that delivered products incrementally and 
quickly. We adopted and saw the benefit of unit testing, continuous 
integration, and static analysis. We found and implemented a technology 
stack that allowed us to be extremely effective at creating real business value. 

## Tools & Technology

The majority of my work for the past decade has been built on the .NET platform 
in C#. I strongly believe that exposure to other platforms and languages gives 
me the ability to bring the appropriate technology to bear on any given problem.

I am extremely proficient in C#, F#, and Javascript and more than a little 
acquainted with OCaml, Ruby, and Python. I can construct and tune complex SQL, 
although I prefer to let my tools do that for me, and I have a passable command 
of MDX.

I have delivered software on all releases of the .NET framework. My most recent 
work is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC 3.
