## Profile

Code craftsman with experience delivering kick-ass software. I am passionate 
about quality and a firm believer in loving what you do.

## History

### Press Ganey Associates, Nashville, Tennessee
*Lead Software Developer*  
*2010–Present (First seven months as a consultant)*

At Press Ganey, I lead a team developing an application used by our customers 
to analyze financial and clinical healthcare data, along with focused tools 
built on the same data sets and made available as separately sold modules. The 
product is used to improve quality of care and the financial performance of 
healthcare organizations.

The team consistently exceeds expectations of quality and productivity. The 
application offers extreme flexibility in filtering and presentation of 
large data sets, quickly and reliably. I relish the unique challenges of 
the product and the joy of delivering software that leaves those challenges 
with a bloody nose.

Few tools for building and manipulating MDX queries exist. The team built a 
tool to enforce syntactically correct query construction, rewrite constructed 
queries, and build a set of classes representing the structure of the cube. 
New features that would have taken weeks to develop can be shipped in days 
without comprimising quality.

I've been successful in warding off the people that seem determined to impose 
tools and processes that don't work for the team with reasonable discussions 
about hard measurements and without shouting matches. I'm as proud of this as 
any technical achievment.

My responsibilities include:

* Design and implementation of new functionality
* Working with Product Management to define requirements and product direction
* Building a team culture of accountability and transparency
* Defining development, testing, and delivery processes
* Mentoring teams working on other clinical products
* Planning and coordinating efforts of multiple, geographically-separated teams

### HCA, Nashville, Tennessee
*Domain Architect*  
*2002-2010 (First eighteen months as a consultant)*

I provided the technical direction for multiple development teams that support 
the Outpatient Services Group of HCA. My day-to-day work consisted of:

* Reviewing business needs and requests for new functionality or products to 
  develop a cohesive plan for future work.
* Designing software to address the needs of the organization.
* Providing guidance to developers during construction.
* Mentoring developers to increase the kick-ass-edness of the team.
* Working with QA and Operations to smooth the delivery of software to 
  production.
* Improving process by any means necessary.
* Working with management to produce estimates of development and testing effort.

We were incredibly effective. Some of the accomplishments of my last few years:

* Enhanced and maintained a physician practice management system (PPMS) that 
  supports over five hundred physician practices. This system is responsible 
  for the scheduling of patient visits, the billing of claims related to those 
  visits, and all the back-office work needed to ensure those claims are paid. 
  There are over ??? users working in ??? practices. The system was used to 
  file ??? claims — for a total amount of ??? — last year alone. The team has 
  delivered enhancements to this system monthly for over a year. It is the 
  largest centralized practice management software installation in existence.
* Designed and developed multiple interfaces and applications in orbit of a new 
  practice management system purchased by HCA. This system presents unique 
  challenges, as the vendor is often not able or willing to provide the 
  information needed to effectively work with PPMS data. The interfaces include 
  an upload of accounting data to the general ledger, an extract of patient 
  visit statistics, and an extract of patient account information used for 
  delinquent payment collections. The applications include a utility used to 
  replicate “master” information between multiple PPMS installations and a 
  suite of tools used to process and post payments from insurance companies. 
  All of these products are critical to the daily operations of the outpatient 
  group.
* Designed and developed a system used to continue practice operations, if and 
  when the replacement practice management system is offline. Understandably, 
  this software has stringent availability and security constraints. It must be 
  available at all times, and patient information must remain protected until 
  needed. It has been called into service many times during the rollout of the 
  new PPMS. Work in the practice proceeds, regardless of downtime or 
  performance degradation.
* Designed and developed a system used by physician recruiters to capture 
  information about job opportunities while in the field and sync the details 
  to the primary application used by this department. Prior to this software, 
  printed forms were used, which caused delays and errors associated with 
  keying the information into the primary application days or weeks later. 
  The timely availability of job information is critical to recruiters. The 
  application uses local storage, which allows the recruiters to work 
  disconnected from the corporate network and sync with a centralized server 
  when connected.
* Designed and developed a system used to track the progress of opening or 
  acquiring new physician practices. This was a replacement for an existing 
  system that failed to meet performance and functional expectations. The new 
  system was designed to be customized and maintained by the end users. We 
  learned a lot of lessons about rewrites, feature creep, and YAGNI on this 
  project. I would consider it a success, but a painful one. We were too 
  worried about future needs and tried to pay for future maintenance up-front. 
  The development department — business development, not programming — lives 
  in this application and uses it for all their daily tasks. The system 
  allows department management to get an accurate picture of the progress on 
  all their active projects.

All of those accomplishments are notable, but I am most proud of the 
improvements we have made to our team, our process, and our interactions with 
the business. When I started at HCA, development was flailing. Now, our team 
is used as an example throughout HCA IT of doing things right. We have 
assembled a team that is stunning in both its technical proficiency and its 
understanding of the business problems it is solving. We have moved from big 
design up-front to an iterative process that delivers products incrementally 
and quickly. We have adopted and seen the benefit of unit testing, continuous 
integration, and static analysis. We have found and implemented a technology 
stack that allows us to be extremely effective at creating real business value. 
I am rightly proud of myself and my team. We are ruthlessly determined to 
removing the roadblocks that prevent us from contributing to the success of HCA.
